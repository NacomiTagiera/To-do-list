# To-do list

This is my first fullstack project. I used **Firebase Realtime Databse** as a backend of this app. In the future, I would like to replace React and Firebase with Next.js and MongoDB.

Available features:

- adding,
- deleting,
- editing,
- setting category and priority of a task,
- searching for tasks,
- sorting.

To-do:

- authentication,
- ability to toggle task completion status.
